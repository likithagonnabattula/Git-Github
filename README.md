# Git-Github
Learn git and github 

To learn Git&Github we need to know four things
1)Vcs(version control system) and Git repos
2)Staging area and commits
3)Branches
4)issues and PR's

1)vcs
Git is a version control system and it conatins some parts
1)remote repository
commands:
git->to see if git is installed correctly in our system
git init->initialize git repository with git
git status->to see the status of git or check if its working
un tracked file->working directory


2)Local repository
3)staging area
This is in between working directory and the local repository
only because of staging area we can send what specific file to be sent and not the entire files
4)working Directory
Every time when you want to send files to remote repository only when the files are stored in local repository can be.
To send files to remote repository we use push 
To send files to local repositoty we use committ
To send files from working directory to staging area we use add
To send files to local repository use ->git commit -m "Commiting  code and example"
